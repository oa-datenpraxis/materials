# OA Datenpraxis: Data practice for shaping the open access transformation - analysis, recommendation, training & networking

## About

The project OA Datenpraxis supports the development of structures for the open access transformation at research institutions in Germany. The focus is on promoting and establishing processes and procedures for sovereign data practice in shaping the open access transformation.

The project supports practitioners in administration, libraries and other service institutions in professionalizing their data practices by promoting the organization, networking and standardization of processes through a coordinated approach.

The project is a joint effort by the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, the Helmholtz Open Science Office and the Göttingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen).

## Materials

Part of the OA Datenpraxis project is to design, test and iteratively develop training courses with a specific focus on data practice to shape the OA transformation. The target group includes professionals in the field of OA transformation and research administration. Not all data analysis aspects can be covered rather, the aim is to introduce open and science-oriented tools and procedures and to test their application.

This repository organizes (training) materials created within the OA Datenpraxis project in thematically organized folders.
